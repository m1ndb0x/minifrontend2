This is an Ai Translator app using React for the frontend, and Python for the backend.  

React was used alongside Tailwind CSS to ultimately create a fast and bautiful design for the website.

The backend uses Python to handle an API call to the AI model and translates the languages, storing the language translation (ex. french to spanish) in your local storage
